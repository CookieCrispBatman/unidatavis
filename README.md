# University Data Visualisation

When choosing university courses, students can compare courses at different universities by using the Unistats website (https://unistats.ac.uk/)

When you compare student satisfaction on the Unistats site, the details are given as percentages which can be hard to interpret. The aim of this project is for you to develop a visual way to compare student satisfaction for different subject areas at different universities.

Student satisfaction data is taken in the National Student Survey and is publically available (https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/student-information-and-data/national-student-survey-nss/get-the-nss-data/)
